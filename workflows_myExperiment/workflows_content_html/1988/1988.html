<p>The ADR-S pathway seeks to establish a connection between the clinical event and the drug through different paths:   	(i) through proteins in common among the proteins that are drug targets or metabolite targets and proteins associated to the clinical event  	(ii) through proteins that are drug targets or metabolite targets and proteins associated to the clinical event that participate in a common biological pathway.  The workflow proceeds as follows:<br />
First, it checks if there are proteins that are annotated both to the clinical event and to the drug (NESTED WORKFLOW ADR_substantiation_through_proteins).<br />
Second, it looks for connections between the drug and the clinical event through biological pathways. Information about tissue expression of the proteins is used to filter the results  Input of the workflow  The input of the workflow is a drug-event pair.   For the clinical events, the following types are allowed:  	1) UMLS CUI concept identifiers (single identifier or a list of identifiers 	2) clinical events observed as adverse drug reactions according to the EU-ADR project  For the drug, a ATC code (7 digit level) is required.  Output of the workflow  As result a list of connecting proteins as well as a list of pathways is provided.   The results can be visualized as a network using Cytoscape. The network is a multi-partite graph, in which the nodes are the event, the drug and the proteins, and the edges the associations between these nodes.

In more detail, the workflow tries to find feasible paths connecting the drug and the event. 

First, it checks if there are proteins that are annotated to a given adverse event and at the same time target of the given drug. (NESTED WORKFLOW ADR_substantiation_through_proteins)

Second, it tries to connect drug and event through biological pathways. Here, it checks if there are proteins from drug and event side which are expressed in the same tissue and also annotated to the same biological pathway.

As adverse event, the following event types are allowed: 
1) events as defined in the EU-ADR project such as UGIB
2) UMLS CUI concept identifiers

As drug input 7 digit drug ATC codes are allowed.

As result a list of intersecting proteins as well as a list of pathways is provided. 
If any of the two lists is not empty, the drug-event pair is substantiated as drug safety signal.  

For the intersecting proteins, a Cytoscape graph is generated for user-friendly visualization. It contains the event, drug and their annotated proteins as well as additional information such as links to publications etc. 

For the intersecting pathways a html page summarizing the results is generated.

2) events of type UMLS being a CUI concept identifier	                      <hr />
                    
                      The clinical event input

For the clinical events, the following input types are allowed: 
	1) UMLS: UMLS CUI concept identifiers 
	2) EUADR_event: clinical events observed as adverse drug reactions according to the EU-ADR project (see ref for details)

If you use option 1), insert here a single UMLS CUI identifier or a list of identifiers. 
If you use option 2), insert here the name of the EUADR_event as defined in ref.	                      <hr />

                      Name of the event. This is only required for user-friendly visualization of the results. In particular, if the input is a CUI concept identifier.	                      <hr />

       <dc:description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ADR-S pathway seeks to establish a connection between the clinical event and the drug through different paths:   	(i) through proteins in common among the proteins that are drug targets or metabolite targets and proteins associated to the clinical event  	(ii) through proteins that are drug targets or metabolite targets and proteins associated to the clinical event that participate in a common biological pathway.  The workflow proceeds as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
First, it checks if there are proteins that are annotated both to the clinical event and to the drug (NESTED WORKFLOW ADR_substantiation_through_proteins).&lt;br /&gt;
Second, it looks for connections between the drug and the clinical event through biological pathways. Information about tissue expression of the proteins is used to filter the results  Input of the workflow  The input of the workflow is a drug-event pair.   For the clinical events, the following types are allowed:  	1) UMLS CUI concept identifiers (single identifier or a list of identifiers 	2) clinical events observed as adverse drug reactions according to the EU-ADR project  For the drug, a ATC code (7 digit level) is required.  Output of the workflow  As result a list of connecting proteins as well as a list of pathways is provided.   The results can be visualized as a network using Cytoscape. The network is a multi-partite graph, in which the nodes are the event, the drug and the proteins, and the edges the associations between these nodes. In addition, all the evidences supporting the associations can be explored in the graph representation.  The results of the analyisis through biological pathways is summarized in an html file.&lt;/p&gt;</dc:description>
