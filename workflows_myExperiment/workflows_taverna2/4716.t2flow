&lt;ImpactDetails&gt;
The Greenfoot system and research has a direct impact in several
 different ways:
 
 During the REF period, it has benefited more than a million school
 students in 49+ countries directly ([I1], [I2], all references to
 Section 5).
 It benefits thousands of teachers who use it to teach programming
 differently ([S2],[S3]).
 It has influenced national curriculum design in the UK ([S1]).
 
 Impact for students. Students benefit by being able to
 achieve more tangible results more quickly, leading to increased motivation and satisfaction, as well as better understanding of programming
 concepts. Before using Greenfoot, many students were taught using
 text-based development environments designed mainly for professional
 programmers. These environments are difficult to use, force learners
 through large amounts of detail before achieving the first motivating
 impact, and possible outputs in reach of early learners are a long way off
 of meeting expectations of students who have grown up with interactive
 graphical software systems. Greenfoot removes all of these problems.
 Many teachers have long been aware of this problem and have struggled to
 teach programming in a more engaging manner. This has been especially
 difficult if the goal was to teach modern concepts of software
 engineering, usually with an object oriented language. Greenfoot helps
 teachers by giving them a tool to meet their goals — teaching
 software development principles and object orientation in a modern,
 graphical context. The impact is aided by the availability of a
 Greenfoot-based textbook: Introduction to Programming with Greenfoot — Object-Oriented Programming in Java with Games and Simulations.
 Michael Kölling. Pearson Education, 2009. ISBN-13: 978-0-13-603753-8. More
 than 16,000 copies of the book have been sold, providing further evidence
 of the popularity of this approach.
 User engagement. User engagement in the research results
 and the resulting software has been achieved via a number of different
 channels. These include keynote talks at educational conferences
 in several different countries, research talks and invited talks at
 conferences, and a large number of teacher and student workshops.
 Publishing the software itself is not sufficient to create lasting impact;
 it was highly effective to go out to conferences where we could interact
 with stakeholders and present the system to them directly. Over the last
 three years, we have reached more than 300 teachers directly in
 face-to-face workshops. A Greenfoot channel on YouTube (http://www.youtube.com/user/18km)
 with instructional videos has received more than 290,000 views over two
 years.
 Computing at School (CAS). Our research group works with
 the Computing At School (CAS) group (www.computingatschool.org.uk),
 which aims to improve the provision of computer science in schools in the
 UK. Greenfoot has become one of the frequently used tools in the group's
 activities, including teacher training workshops. In a letter [S1]
 supporting this case study, Simon Humphreys, BCS and coordinator of CAS,
 wrote: "The pedagogy that underpins Greenfoot is exemplary. It has an
 active, supportive, worldwide community, tutorials and teaching plans.
 It has a special place with pupils at KS4 and A Level and CAS are
 privileged to be able to work with the Greenfoot team in supporting
 classroom practitioners."
 Feedback. The impact for students and the effectiveness of
 the dissemination is evidenced by frequent unsolicited feedback from
 teachers. Following are two typical quotes from instructors:
 "By the way, I gave my Year 12/13s a choice of what to do their
 projects in, and 16 out of 18 chose Greenfoot. The progress they've made
 so far compared to this time last year on VB or php/Javascript is
 amazing. I see a whole pile of A's appearing in due course!"
 - Andrew Tringham, Teacher, Archbishop Tenison's School, Croydon,
 (see statement [S2])
 "On Monday they could stay at home for me to see and exercise your
 `Joy of Code' movies. With the notion that they would receive an
 assignment on Tuesday. I'm always very suspicious, and I didn't thought
 that they would go seriously through the material. Monday at midnight, I
 gave the assignment free. Normally in the morning when I enter a
 classroom, IT-students are still half sleeping or reading the online
 journal, or checking their Facebook,... Yesterday, it was amazing. The
 room was fully occupied before 9 o'clock with 80 students! There was an
 enormous rumor. I saw drawings, heard discussions, saw already things
 pass on a colored screens. So, they needed no introduction, yet there
 were already fully occupied with their scenario. The whole day long they
 were working in pairs on their scenario and asked many questions. Some
 students went on Monday through all your 33 movies of the Joy of Code.
 Incredible! For me, one of the big advantages of Greenfoot is, that the
 students `see' immediately result. And therefore they are urged to get
 further on."
 - Chantal Teerlinck HUB-Hogeschool Universiteit Brussel (see statement
 [S3])
 James Gosling, the creator of Java, also commented on Greenfoot after
 seeing his daughter use it:
 "Greenfoot makes it fun to learn programming. It starts out with very
 logo-ish exercises (moving a wombat around via method calls to find
 food), then automating the characters so that they can find their own
 food, and progressing to a variety of video games. The scenarios really
 absorb kids." (Full statement available.) (see statement [S4])
 The direct feedback from teachers shows that the goal of increasing
 motivation and engagement in learners is being reached, and that the
 Greenfoot system has indeed made a significant contribution in causing
 change in students' attitudes. The value as seen by the wider community is
 also evidenced by a significant number of volunteer contributions to
 the project, often in the form of translations. The Greenfoot user
 interface has been translated into 12 languages (including Chinese,
 Portuguese, German and Spanish), and the Greenfoot tutorials have been
 translated into seven languages. These translations were produced by
 volunteers who invested significant amounts of time to make these
 contributions.
 Scaling up. For international support and distribution and
 the scaling up of face-to-face support, we have established 8 Greenfoot Hubs in different parts of the world (concentrating mainly on
 the US, following our user distribution, see http://www.greenfoot.org/hubs/).
 These Hubs are run by volunteer academics from other institutions in close
 coordination with us, and they provide local Greenfoot training and
 support, using resources developed and shared by all hubs. In 2012, the
 hubs have delivered 12 teacher training workshops.
 To establish a self-sustaining community we developed two supporting
 websites — one for end users (students) and one for teachers. The user
 site provides direct help and discussion about Greenfoot programming and
 the teacher site provides teaching material and advice on educational
 topics. The Greenfoot user site currently has approximately
 4500 users subscribed and receives more than 47,000 site visits
 (210,000 page views) per month. It contains more than 2,500 programmed
 Greenfoot examples, uploaded by approximately 1,900 distinct users, and an
 active discussion section. The Greenfoot teacher site, the
 Greenroom, currently has more than 2,400 teachers signed up, who
 uploaded more than 120 resources and are engaged in discussion. We
 estimate that through these teachers alone we reach more than 30,000
 students.
 Downloads. The impact is plainly evidenced by download
 numbers. The Greenfoot software is currently downloaded more than
 350,000 times per year, with annual downloads increasing.
 National and international reach. Most of the impact is
 international, with adoption spread through more than 49 countries (see
 section 5, reference 2). Adoption is strongest in North America and
 western Europe. Nationally, Greenfoot is now also highly recommended by Computing At Schools, who are involved with the development of UK curricula
 (see reference 9, below) and Greenfoot is referenced in national
 curriculum documents as one of the useful tools to enable the
 teaching of programming for that age group. Through this, the research has
 an impact in changing the way computing is presented in UK schools.
 In conclusion, we note that Alison J. Derbenwick Miller, Vice President
 of Oracle Academy confirms the impact and reach of Greenfoot in a
 statement [S5]: "Our continued philanthropic investment in the project
 reflect our recognition of the impact and importance of Greenfoot to
 support the learning of computer science and programming using [Java].
 Greenfoot makes initial programming more easily accessible and has
 helped millions of beginning programmers to become engaged with software
 development. ... Oracle Academy has chosen to include Greenfoot in its
 Java Fundamentals course curriculum used by K-12 teachers globally. ...
 During the 2013 academic year Oracle Academy delivered introduction to
 Computer Science training to approx. 6,000 teachers worldwide. The
 Greenfoot environment is an important part of our Java curriculum, and
 we are proud to continue to support its development at the University of
 Kent."
&lt;/ImpactDetails&gt;
&lt;ImpactSummary&gt;
Greenfoot is a software system to support the learning of programming at
 school level (age 13 upwards). During the REF period, over a million
 students worldwide have learned programming through Greenfoot: at school,
 in after school clubs and workshops, and privately at home. Greenfoot has
 helped to raise the profile of programming in schools and outside in a
 number of countries. The research described here has had impact on a
 variety of stakeholders, including pupils, teachers and those involved in
 national curriculum development. Greenfoot is currently downloaded more
 than 350,000 times/year and is in active use in thousands of schools.
 Greenfoot is one of very few systems, internationally, to have this level
 of impact on programming education.

&lt;UnderpinningResearch&gt;
The research for this project has two strands: pedagogical research
 and technical computer science research. Our project group at the
 University of Kent carried out the research in both areas, including the
 development of new interaction techniques to support the learning of
 programming, designed and implemented the software, and conducted
 additional research on the usability and effectiveness of the resulting
 system. The overall Greenfoot project is reported in [2], [3] provides an
 introduction to parts of the ecosystem created as a result of the
 pedagogical research, and the Greenfoot textbook (see Section 4) embodies
 the pedagogical approach created as part of the Greenfoot project.
 The project is led by Michael Kölling, Professor, University of Kent,
 (hereafter Kent), 2005-present, and the initial pedagogical research
 and system design was carried out jointly with Poul Henriksen,
 Research Associate, (hereafter RA) Kent, 2005-2009, in cooperation with
 John Rosenberg (Professor, La Trobe University) and Bruce Quig (RA, La
 Trobe). Later research work from 2007 to 2013 made original
 contributions to HCI in the context of novice programming systems,
 introducing interaction techniques that allow more experimentation and
 exploration, accelerate feedback, and — through this — increase
 engagement and motivation. This work allows new learning approaches
 that invert traditional curricula (allowing discussion of high level
 ("advanced") concepts before discussion of syntax; see [1], section 3). We
 contributed novel interaction techniques to programming
 environment technology that allow a more direct and experimental approach
 to interacting with a programming system. This work was carried out by
 Kölling, Ian Utting (Senior Lecturer, Kent), Neil Brown (RA, Kent) and
 Davin McCall (RA, Kent).
 Pedagogically, we based the work on constructivist learning theories. We
 specialised general constructivist theories and applied them to the
 initial learning of programming, and specifically to the learning and
 teaching of concepts of object orientation ([1], sec. 3). This led us to
 formulate goals and targets for system characteristics, such as interactivity,
 visualisation, and support for self-directed experimentation,
 thus making original contributions to computing pedagogy.
 The second strand of our research was concerned with developing computer
 system abstractions and interaction techniques to realise
 these goals in the context of a modern, statically typed, object-oriented
 language (Java, in our case). Some of the techniques are adapted from
 earlier highly interactive programming systems, such as Smalltalk and
 Self, and have been adapted to the statically typed nature of Java.
 Specifically, we developed a new conceptual framework of
 object-oriented programming concepts and concrete novel interaction
 techniques ([1, 2]).
 Another important aspect of this project concerns community and social support for learners. Our research showed that the ecosystem
 (community, discussion, availability of material) has a major influence on
 learning success, and we developed a technology-supported online community
 around Greenfoot. This part of the project included the development of novel social interaction models, combining aspects of resource
 repositories and social networks. These research
 contributions to computing education and HCI were reported in conference
 papers [4,5].
 The research was supported by a series of industry grants over a period
 of several years. Each grant was for a one-year term, and each grant was
 awarded based on the outputs of the research previously completed. Grants
 received include $650,000 from SUN Microsystems (2005-2008), $450,000 SUN
 foundation (2009-2010), $1.1m from Oracle Corp (2011-2013) and $36,000
 from Google (2011-2013), totalling more than US$2.2 million. These
 companies see the value of Greenfoot in "filling the pipeline" of software
 developers, thus sustaining the health of the industry.
